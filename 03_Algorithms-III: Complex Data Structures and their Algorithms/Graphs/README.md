| **Interval Graphs**      | Graphs where each vertex can be associated with an interval on the real line, and edges exist between vertices if their corresponding intervals overlap.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | - **Intersection Model**: Vertices represent intervals, edges represent overlaps.<br>- **Applications**: Scheduling problems, genetics, where time intervals or gene overlaps are modeled.<br>- **Recognition**: Can be recognized in linear time.                                                                                                                                          |
